# CropPrediction
This project focuses on predicting the most suitable crops for cultivation based on various environmental factors such as soil type, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The goal is to analyze agricultural data, identify critical patterns, and build a predictive model to support farmers in making informed decisions.

Libraries Used:

NumPy (numpy): A core library for numerical computations, used for efficient data manipulation, mathematical operations, and handling large datasets in the project.

Pandas (pandas): Utilized for loading, cleaning, and processing agricultural data, including transformations, aggregations, and exploratory data analysis.

Matplotlib (matplotlib.pyplot): Used to create static and interactive visualizations such as line graphs and scatter plots, aiding in the understanding of data trends and correlations.

Seaborn (seaborn): Leveraged to design advanced statistical graphics like heatmaps and pair plots, providing deeper insights into feature relationships and patterns in the dataset.

Scikit-learn (sklearn): Implemented machine learning models for classification, enabling accurate predictions of suitable crops based on input features.
